Pagination is a technique used to divide large datasets into smaller, more manageable pages. This is essential for improving website performance, user experience, and server load. By breaking down large datasets, pagination allows for faster loading times, better user interface, and more efficient resource utilization.

Key Concepts

    Page Size: The number of items displayed per page.
    Page Number: The current page being viewed.
